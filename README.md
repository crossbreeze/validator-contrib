Contributed validation functions for use with package validator

To contribute, please sent pull requests but please make sure
contributed validation function is inside its own folder.

If your pull request is accepted, you'll retain ownership of it
and I'll give you contributor access to this repo.

By default, I assume all validators will be released under the
Apache License 2.0. If you prefer something else, please make
sure you include license information inside your validator folder.
Note that I cannot accept proprietary validators (although let's
face it, you wouldn't be contributing it either, so we're all
good.)
